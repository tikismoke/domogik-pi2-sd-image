For now you need at least a 4go sd card. The image could work on a 2go but as not been test for that.
Don't forget for now it is just a proof of concept. It hasn't been test for long running period.

Based on last Raspbian-jessie-lite (2016-05-10)

Remenber to expand filesysem at first boot

- Connect a keyboard and a screen to the pi2, login as pi/raspberry, sudo raspi-config and expand filesystem.
- It could be slow to login on 1st boot don't worry. After that reboot to aplly new filesystem.
- When expand will be finished, you can put your pi in another place and play with domogik.

For me it tooks ~1 and 2 minutes to have the domogik admin page ready after powering the pi2.

SSH enable by default
Dhcp enable

Domogik/Domoweb use default port (40406/40404), no ssl, and default login/password (admin/123)

User/password for ssh:
pi/raspberry

User domoweb as domopass as password

Mysql db root password domopass

Change to make to accord your installation:

In /etc/domoweb.cfg line 5 change rest_url to your pi2 IP.


Almost all plugins are install with this version in dev branch.
